# nokia-snake-game
This is a fun remake of the classic Nokia Snake game using Arduino Uno, an OLED display, and a joystick. Control the snake, eat food, and beat your high score! It has sound effects, adjustable speed, and saves your best score. Great for anyone curious about electronics and retro games.
